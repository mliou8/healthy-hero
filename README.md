This is an app where users are served a random healthy food each day. 
It was based on a problem that I had that I felt like there was too much information about healthy foods available.

For now the app serves up foods based on their nutrition value, but in the future I'd like to programatically serve 
up foods based on proximity to the user.


The technologies used were: Angular, MongoDb, Express, and Node.js
